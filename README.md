Overview of spatial intelligence from a cognitive map perspective.
</h6>

This survey revisits **Spatial Intelligence** from the perspective of **Cognitive Maps**, treating cognitive maps as the representational blueprint that connects spatial perception, reasoning, and generation. Under this view, diverse research directions can be understood through a shared question: **how an internal spatial representation is constructed, maintained, reasoned over, and realized**.

We organize the literature into three cognitive-map-centric processes:

- **Perception: Construction of Cognitive Maps** — how agents build internal spatial representations from local, partial, and multimodal observations.
- **Reasoning: Inference with Cognitive Maps** — how cognitive maps are used as embeddings, prompts, or APIs to support spatial inference and decision-making.
- **Generation: Realization of Cognitive Maps** — how internal maps are externalized into 3D scenes and dynamic world simulations.

This repository provides a curated list of papers analyzed in the survey, following the taxonomy proposed in **Spatial Intelligence from a Cognitive Map Perspective: A Survey**.
